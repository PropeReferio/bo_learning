1. squash in merge in the PR UI.
2. Put #21005 to refer to commit, put KST-95 (or something) to link to Jira tickets. Put these in commit messages so they persist.
3. Use git rebase -i when PR from feature branch to develop.
4. Use git merge when going from develop to production, canary, or other rc (to preserve history)	
5. git commit --amend (--no-edit [dont change commit message]) (-m [write commit message without editor])
