Content coupling - where something modifies a class object directly
  - Law of Demeter/Principle of Least Knowledge (specific kind) - when a function
  needs to know about the properties of an object (can be solved by making
  the function a class method), a data structure, etc.

global coupling - multiple things pointing to one global constant... if you change
the constant, everything using it changes. Results in code duplication.

external coupling - depending on an external service, like an API

control coupling - one function controls the flow of another function

stamp coupling - when data structures are coupled. It's bad when you're only using the 
keys of a dict, and none of the values, in some cases.

data coupling - when methods share data, taking the same arguments. This can be eliminated
by employing message passing.

import coupling - you imported something

message coupling - passing messages around. Typically it's very light coupling.
