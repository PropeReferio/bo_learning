Mixins are complicated, because if you change the order of
inheritance/class parameters, things change a lot.

Arjan doesn't recommend mixins because:
1) Type hints get screwed up
2) Using it limits OOP features. You can't add instance variables, etc.
3) Juniors won't know how to use them, and will screw them up.
4) Are @dataclasses compatible? Not sure.
5) If you need to add an instance variable, you're stuck. Refactoring becomes hard.

Just use composition, says Arjan.
