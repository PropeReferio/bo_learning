Use a dataclass when:
1) You'll make few methods
2) It's more a collection of data than a collection of 
behaviours
3) You have a bunch of instance variables/attributes
4) It's like a row of a DB

Use a class when:
1) You need a custom initializer
2) don't care about the __repr__ method
3) It's more a collection of behaviours than of
data
